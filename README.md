# Liveness-Detection

Uses Haar cascade classifiers to detect faces and a Convolutional Neural Network to detect if the image is LIVE or FAKE in real time.
The surroundings and image quality is take into consideration.
The project can also be implemented by using Multi Task Cascading Neural Network to detect faces instead of Haar cascades to improve accuracy and decrease False positives and negative but is discouraged in real time scenarios in Computers without a GPU.

# How-to:

Just run the face.py file.
